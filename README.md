Food Sharing Tool (FST) is an activity based interactive tool, designed and developed by Connected Learning Initiative (CLIx). This interactive tool is designed by the CLIx Mathematics Team and MIT, based on the digital pedagogy concepts of Fractions and Food Sharing for high school students. This design was then converted into the digital tool by the CLIx technology team. 

This tool is divided into 3 Lessons with a total of 11 activities. It is also available in two Indian languages - Hindi and Telegu apart from English.

### Technology Behind the development.
This interactive is developed using open source HTML5 & javascript game framework named Phaser.

### Standalone Installation instruction
Step 1:- To install the game you have to clone the git repository in you local computer. Type the commands to your terminal.
        (Preriqusite git software has to be installed in your system)
    
```git clone https://github.com/CLIxIndia-Dev/food_sharing_tool.git``` 
                      or 
```git clone https://github.com/tanvidom/food_sharing_tool.git```
                      
    
Step 2:- Unzip this folder and copy it in the root directory of your server.If you using apache in linux, then your root Directory would be at:- 

```/var/www/html```
    
Or you can use brackets editor and open this folder in brackets and click on the electricity icon on the top right corner of your editor screen for live preview this will create a temporary local server for your development enviornment.

Step 3:- This step is optional but recommended to change the permission of you direcctory to 755.To do so below is the command

```chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/food_sharing_tool```

Step 4:- Just visit the url of the server. If your are running a local server then the url will be 
    
``` localhost:8080```

# Design Documentation 

This interactive tool was designed during the MIT Design Camp held in 2016. The CLIx Mathematics Team and MIT Curriculum Team was involved in pedagogy behind the game and its conceptional design. 
After pilot testing and discussion among the team, there was an idea of sharing as well as cutting tool as separate activities.

# Future Scope 

Their is a lot of scope in further development of this tool. The screen size and resolution of the game can also be increased so as to fit different screen sizes. Currently these activities are within the lessons in the CLIxModules but they can be created as independent tools as well. One more independent tool which can be created is the number of parathas and the number of workers or the number of cakes and the number of children can also be selected by the user for the cutting tool.
